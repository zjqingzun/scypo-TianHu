SHORT DESCRIPTION
    TianHu software user guide support toolkit.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    TianHu Help describes system commands, functions, scripts, modules, 
    modes, complex operations, and the use of professional training models.

    TianHu can only support users within the framework of the current 
    available software version. However, a better support version can be 
    updated using the provided UPDATE-HELP package. The ONLINE-HELP package 
    can also be used for more specific support from the application developer.

    Without help files, Get-Help displays auto-generated help for commands,
    functions, and scripts, etc.
